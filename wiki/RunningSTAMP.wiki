#summary How to run STAMP benchmarks using transmem

In order to run STAMP you'll need to first download the STAMP benchmarks, available from [http://stamp.stanford.edu/ stamp's website]. I've tested this with 0.9.7 (I know 0.9.8 is now available, perhaps I'll test this soon).

  * install the stamp benchmarks somewhere (e.g. /mnt/scratch/stamp/stamp-0.9.7)
  * insert the files in transmem/stamp into the relevant stamp file.
