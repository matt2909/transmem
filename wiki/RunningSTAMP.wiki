#summary How to run STAMP benchmarks using transmem

In order to run STAMP you'll need to first download the STAMP benchmarks, available from [http://stamp.stanford.edu/ stamp's website]. I've tested this with 0.9.7 (I know 0.9.8 is now available, perhaps I'll test this soon).

  * install the stamp benchmarks somewhere (e.g. /mnt/scratch/stamp/stamp-0.9.7)
  * insert the files in transmem/stamp into the relevant stamp directories.

The script files (inside transmem/scripts) assume that you have x86 linux checkpoints for various number of processor configurations. If you are a local user you can get the checkpoints as follows:
{{{
su
cp /home/stella/simics/craffs/tango1-fedora5.craff opt/virtutech/simics-3.0.31/targets/x86-440bx/images/
exit
cd SIMICS_WORKSPACE
cp /home/stella/simics/checkpoints .
cp /home/stella/simics/
}}}
You can now run one of the example scripts e.g:

{{{
cd SIMICS_WORKSPACE
./simics -stall modules/transmem-read-only/scripts/tm_bayes_tm.simics
}}}

*Depending on your version of GCC you may need to remove the file <simics>/x86-linux/sys/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 so that it doesn't conflict when you compiler*
