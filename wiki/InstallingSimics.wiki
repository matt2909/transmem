#summary A guide to locally installing simics

This guide will walk you through installing Simics on your local machine, this is fairly specific to our local setup in Manchester, so please just install simics as per your user manual as a fail-safe. 

The following instructions assume you are installing on your local machine, you have root or can get root permissions there, and that simics is not already installed.

 * cd /tmp
 * cp /home/stella/simics/install-files/simics-pkg-20-3.0.31-linux.tar .
 * tar -xvf simics-pkg-20-3.0.31-linux.tar
 * cd simics-3.0-install/
 * su
 * ./install-simics.sh 
  
You will be asked for an encryption key at this point, it can be found in /home/stella/simics/key.txt

 * choose all the default answers (yes, 1, /opt/virtutech, yes)

You should now see the following message:
{{{
Simics 3.0.31 was successfully installed as /opt/virtutech/simics-3.0.31/

No Simics add-on packages requested to be installed.

Each Simics user can now create a workspace, or update an existing
one, by running the following script:

    /opt/virtutech/simics-3.0.31/bin/workspace-setup
}}}

If you do see the message above then simics installed correctly. You now need to create yourself a workspace, essentially an area that links to simics within your own userspace, or if you prefer somewhere on your /scratch partition (at your own risk of losing it!!).

You can set up a workspace in a directory of your choice by using the command :
{{{
    /opt/virtutech/simics-3.0.31/bin/workspace-setup
}}}

Thats it simics is now installed and ready to run!
