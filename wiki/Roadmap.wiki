#summary This page details the roadmap for the transmem project.
== To-do list ==

The transmem project is currently in an embryonic stage and there is much work that needs to be done to build the project into something better. The following list contains suggestions for future improvements. 

  * Test against all current STAMP benchmarks for functionality.
  * Code tidy-up effort.
  * Stall handling, pass values back to stall the memory accesses.
  * Multiple invocations, currently the thrift socket is 9090 it should be set per run.
  * Automate (through the tm header) turning the memory model on/off.
  * Automate some (limited for now) statistics gathering.
