#summary This page details the roadmap for the transmem project.
== To-do list ==

The transmem project is currently in an embryonic stage and there is much work that needs to be done to build the project into something better. The following list contains suggestions for future improvements. 

  * Test against all current STAMP benchmarks for functionality.
    (kmeans(y), genome(-), labyrinth(-), bayes(-), vacation(-))
  * Add early release pragma for labyrinth (Lee's TM).
  * Code tidy-up effort.
  * Stall handling, pass values back to stall the memory accesses (minimally implemented).
  * Multiple invocations, currently the thrift socket is 9090 it should be set per run.
  * Automate (through the tm header) turning the memory model on/off.
  * Automate some (limited for now) statistics gathering.
  
  * Possibly transactionify the Parsec benchmarks?



===Stall Handling===

Partially implemented currently just passing back a constant value from the timing_model. Need to set this to *infinity* and then trigger a reset on a cycle event. Also need to handle cycle events.
